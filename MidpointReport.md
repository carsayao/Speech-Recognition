# Midpoint Report

The midpoint report for the Speech Visualization team's Implementation Project

## Updates to Project Objective, Project Approach, and Team Structure.

Our original objective was to use various tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, pyAudioanalysis, and scipy to create visualizations of the audio files in our dataset. The goal is to show:
- How these tools visualize our data,
-  Find the averages of various features between same words to compare with other words and,
- Perform some clustering algorithms to find and visualize patterns.

Our approach will be to gather some statistics for each instance of a specific word, find the average of these statistics, and then visualize them alongside the words we are trying to recognize.

There is no explicit team structure established. Progress comes in the form of individual research, presentation of our findings, and steady expansion of our code. As the codebase grows, each member will likely focus on extracting/analyzing/plotting one or two statistics. Finally, they will be all tied together at the end.

## Update on Progress with respect to Project Milestones

We have met most of the initial milestones we set, as we have been able to:
- Process audio data
- Plot various features of the audio files in our dataset

We are close to completing functionality to aggregate the data from the processed files. This will allow us to then cluster data to find trends and patterns. There are a few more steps that may be necessary such as cleaning up and filtering the data. This will allow us to gather more meaningful information from the audio files.
