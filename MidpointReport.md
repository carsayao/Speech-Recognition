# Midpoint Report
The midpoint report for an Implementation Project should be approximately two pages long and should consist of:

- Updates to Project Objective, Project Approach, and Team Structure.

  Our original objective was to use various tools such as matplotlib, seaborn,   pyAudioanalysis, and scipy to create visualizations of the audio files in our
  dataset. The goal is to show how these tools can be used to visualize the data,
  and then to find the averages of various features of recordings for the same word
  to compare with other words and possibly perform some clustering algorithms
  to find and visualize patterns. Our approach will be to gather a number of
  statistics for each instance of a specific word, find the average of these
  statistics, and then visualize them alongside the words we are trying to
  recognize. There is no explicit team structure that has been established, as
  we are all doing work and research on our own and presenting findings to the
  rest of the team. As we begin to expand our codebase, each member will likely
  focus on extracting/analyzing/plotting one or two statistics and then they will
  be all tied together at the end.

- Update on progress with respect to Project Milestones from the Project Plan.

  We have met most of the initial milestones we set, as we have been able to
  successfully process and plot various features of the audio files in our data
  set. We are close to completing the functionality to aggregate the data from
  the processed files, and that will allow us to cluster the data and find trends
  and patterns. There are a few more steps that may be necessary such as
  cleaning up and filtering the data to allow us to gather more accurate and
  meaningful information from the audio files.

  - Include any modifications or adjustments to your project plan.
- Date / time of scheduled midpoint meeting with Prof.
